# Operations

These commands are the main firmware operation entrypoints.

## Start or redeploy

```bash
bash ./scripts/deploy.sh
bash ./scripts/deploy.sh --build
```

- `deploy.sh`
  pulls the prebuilt `flight-core` image, builds the default gateway images, and starts the stack
- `deploy.sh --build`
  builds from the local source tree and then starts the runtime

The default Nano services are:

- `flight-core`
- `control-gateway`
- `pointcloud-gateway`

Optional services are enabled through Compose profiles:

```bash
docker compose --profile media up -d media-gateway
docker compose --profile vision up -d vision-gateway
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.build.yml --profile planner up -d planner
```

## Rebuild only

```bash
bash ./scripts/build.sh
```

`build.sh` rebuilds the firmware image from the current source tree.
It uses the `docker-compose.build.yml` override for local source builds.
The current release has been validated with a clean source build and includes retry handling for base dependency installation.

## Start or stop the container

```bash
bash ./scripts/up.sh
bash ./scripts/up.sh --build
bash ./scripts/down.sh
```

## Inspect state

```bash
bash ./scripts/status.sh
bash ./scripts/logs.sh
bash ./scripts/enter.sh
```

`enter.sh` opens a shell inside the runtime container, normally for inspecting ROS state in `flight-core`.
The runtime user inside the container is `uav`, which avoids routine root execution during operation.
